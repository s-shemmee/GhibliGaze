                Hey there ‡´Æ À∂·µî ·µï ·µîÀ∂ ·Éê! Let's dive into the magical world of Studio Ghibli üå±, co-founded in '85 by the dynamic duo of animated wonders, <strong>Isao Takahata</strong> and <strong>Hayao Miyazaki</strong>.
                <br />
                This powerhouse has crafted twenty-two awe-inspiring films. Think box office gold‚Äîmost of their creations soared to the top in Japan, and <strong>SPIRITED AWAY</strong>, directed by Miyazaki in 2001, holds the record as Japan's highest-grossing film, earning over 30 billion yen! üí∏

                But it's not just about the numbers. Ghibli films are a magnet for awards and acclaim. <strong>SPIRITED AWAY</strong> clinched the Golden Bear at the 2002 Berlin International Film Festival and bagged the 2002 Academy Award for <strong>Best Animated Feature Film</strong>. Adding a touch of magic to reality, they teamed up to create the <strong>Ghibli Museum</strong> in 2001, a whimsical creation in Mitaka designed by the legendary Miyazaki.
